```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

Data import.

We created a new variable called montg, created using lubridate::floor_date().Lubridate is the package that designs for you to manipulation in date variables.Round down the date to the nearest month.   

```{r data_import, cache=TRUE}
library(rnoaa)

weather_df = 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(c("USW00094728", "USC00519397", "USS0023B17S"),
                      var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
                      date_min = "2017-01-01",
                      date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY", 
                      USC00519397 = "Waikiki_HA",
                      USS0023B17S = "Waterhole_WA"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10,
  month = lubridate::floor_date(date, unit = "month")) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())

View(weather_df)
```

##  Start grouping 

group by (): insert the varaible that you are interested in grouping by. 

In the Console pane, you will see: For example: Groups: nam, month [36]. The 36 in the bracket is the distinct number of pairs with the grouping order. 

Use the ungroup, you could ungroup any groups you have.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  group_by(name)
```
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  group_by(name,month)
```

Summarize:  summarize (number=n())： how many elements in each group. Create a summary inside of the group.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(name,month) %>%
  summarize(number = n())
```

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(number=n())
```

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(number=n())
```

Other summary functions...
  
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   count(month) 
```
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   count(name, month) 
```

## Group summaries 

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(name, month) %>%
  summarize(number=n(),
            mean_tmax =mean(tmax))%>% View 
```
Look at the table output, you will find that Waikiki_HA have some missing values. R will convert mean whnen there is a missing vaule in the group.

We could address this...

num_na = sum(is.na(tmax)): is tmax missing yes/no, if it is NA it will give me a true, otherwise it will give me a false. Create a variable called num_na, which summarizes the total number of the missing observations.
 
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(name, month) %>%
  summarize(number=n(),
            num_na = sum(is.na(tmax)),
            mean_tmax =mean(tmax))%>% View 
```

If we want to omit the missing values...
?mean. We found out that na.rm function strips NA vaules. 

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(name, month) %>%
  summarize(number=n(),
            mean_tmax =mean(tmax, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_prcp =median(prcp, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_tmin = sd(tmin, na.rm=TRUE))
```

If use mutate, it will fill out the mean tmax for each name, but will not have differnt mean tmax for each group.
```{r}
weather_df %>% 
   group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(mean_tmax=mean(tmax, na.rm=TRUE))
```

This is still a tibble! 

```{r}
month_df = weather_df %>% 
  group_by(name, month) %>% 
  summarize(number = n(),
            mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE),
            median_prcp = median(prcp, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_tmin = sd(tmin, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

plot two tibbles at once...
```{r}
ggplot(weather_df, aes(x = date, y = tmax, color = name)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + 
  geom_line(data = month_df, aes(x = month, y = mean_tmax))
```

Tidy is not always the best...
Use the speard function to make data more readable.

```{r}
weather_df %>% 
  group_by(name, month) %>% 
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  spread(key = name, value = mean_tmax) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```
